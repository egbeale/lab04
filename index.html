        <p>My dog, Blanche, is just the best. She sleeps a lot and never makes a fuss. When she hears the word "roll," she throws herself on the ground and puts on a big show. She loves people and it's possible she thinks of herself as a human. Nothing irritates her more than when her brother, Pat the Cat, tries to cuddle or play with her. She thinks he is desperate and rotten. But she tolerates his presence because she really is the best.</p>
